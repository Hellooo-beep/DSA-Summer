 OSI Model – 7 Layers of Networking

| Layer | Name          | Real-Life Example                 |
|-------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| 7     | Application   | Web browser (Chrome, Firefox)   |
| 6     | Presentation  | Encryption (SSL), JPEG format   |
| 5     | Session       | Login session (Zoom, WhatsApp)  |
| 4     | Transport     | TCP, UDP (ensures delivery)     |
| 3     | Network       | IP addressing                   |
| 2     | Data Link     | MAC address, switches           |
| 1     | Physical      | Cables, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth        |

 TCP/IP, Ports & Protocols

### TCP/IP Model Layers (4 Layers)

| Layer           | Description                  | Real-Life Example                |
|-----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Application     | Interfaces with software apps | HTTP (web), FTP (file transfer) |
| Transport       | End-to-end communication      | TCP (reliable), UDP (fast)      |
| Internet        | Routing & addressing          | IP (Internet Protocol)          |
| Network Access  | Physical transmission         | Ethernet, Wi-Fi                 |

Ports

- Ports are numbers that identify specific processes or services on a computer.
- Common Ports:
  - 80 – HTTP (web browsing)
  - 443 – HTTPS (secure web browsing)
  - 25 – SMTP (email sending)
  - 22 – SSH (secure remote login)

Protocols

- Protocols are rules that define how data is sent and received.
- Examples:
  - HTTP/HTTPS – Web browsing
  - FTP – File transfer
  - SMTP – Email sending
  - TCP/UDP – Transport protocols ensuring delivery or speed
